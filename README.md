# 🚗 Urban Traffic Flow Monitor

A real-time traffic monitoring and prediction system built for demonstration purposes. This project simulates traffic flow patterns and predicts potential congestion using machine learning.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

## 🎮 Features

- Real-time traffic flow simulation
- ML-based traffic prediction
- Interactive dashboard with live updates
- Automatic congestion detection and alerts
- Visualization of historical and predicted traffic patterns

## 📊 Dashboard

The Streamlit dashboard shows:
- Current traffic flow rate
- Real-time traffic alerts
- Interactive graph with historical data and predictions
- 15-minute future traffic predictions

## 🔧 Technical Details

- Built with Python 3.8+
- Uses Streamlit for the dashboard
- Scikit-learn for traffic prediction
- Plotly for interactive visualizations

## 📝 Note

This is a demonstration project that uses simulated data. The traffic patterns are generated using a realistic model that includes:
- Regular daily patterns
- Rush hour effects
- Random variations
